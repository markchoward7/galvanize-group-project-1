Some sort of administrator login function? 

Administrators add people to the squadron - but should AFPC already add them to the squadron? 
    Perhaps you pull them from an existing database that already has their squadron - that makes more sense

inter- or intra- squadron competitions? Or both? 

Would it tie to Scott's database of the workouts people have done? 
    I feel like it would have to unless we had like "fitness days" that were specifically competition days
    It could just 'fetch' data from Scott's database - no?
